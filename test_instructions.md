# Test Instructions

To test the modified workflows and verify that the GitHub Actions runs are now successful, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Checkout the branch that contains the modified workflows.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the buildchecker workflow by executing the following command:
   ```
   npm run buildchecker
   ```
   This will trigger the buildchecker workflow and perform the necessary checks.
5. Verify that the buildchecker workflow completes successfully without any errors or failures.
6. Run the pr-auditor workflow by executing the following command:
   ```
   npm run pr-auditor
   ```
   This will trigger the pr-auditor workflow and check the pull requests.
7. Verify that the pr-auditor workflow completes successfully and provides accurate results for the pull requests.
8. Repeat the above steps for different scenarios and test cases to ensure the modified workflows function as expected.

It is important to note that the above instructions assume that you have the necessary permissions and access to run the workflows. If you encounter any issues or errors during the testing process, please refer to the troubleshooting section in the repository's documentation or reach out to the repository maintainers for assistance.

Happy testing!
